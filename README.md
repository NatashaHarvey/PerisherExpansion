# PerisherExpansion
Capability analysis for the hypothetical expansion of Perisher Blue ski resort taking into account elevation, slope, tree height and snow cover. 

The ModelBuilder model (Built in ArcMap) will be upoloaded as well as the intermediate data. The original data will not be uploaded as I don't have the rights to it.

The Geodatabase.gdb contains all the intermediate data.
Project.mxd is the ArcMAP document.
Project_Toolbox.tbx contains the model (Cap_Model). Often this is zoomed in when first opened (so all that can be seen in white) but if made full extent then the entire model will become visible.
